For those familiar with the basics of hud editing but not budhud: In other huds, a majority of the files you edit are located in the root hud directory under `resource` and `scripts`. In budhud, this only applies to some files. A majority of the files you'll want to edit will be located within the `..\budhud\_budhud\` directory.
